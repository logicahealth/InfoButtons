This is a migration guide for administrators of OpenInfobutton 1.6 who would like to migrate to version 1.7 while
maintaining their existing profile database.

1 - Notes
2 - Database Migration
3 - Building and redeploy

Notes
-----

1) 1.7 uses new default database names, however for simplicities sake, the migration scripts assumes the same database
   names found in 1.6, while making all the other changes to the underlying tables. This means that before building you
   must change the default database names found in the oib-service pom.xml configuration parameters.

2) For running LITE, you must also set configuration parameters found in oib-site-lite-rest-server/env.json to match
   your database names, depending on if you're using a fresh install or keeping your old profile database.

Database Migration
------------------

1) The scripts assume they are being run as the root mysql user against the localhost database.

2) Find the migration script found in DeploymentPackage/dbScripts/migration1617.sql , modify if necessary due to
   differences in your environment that are assumed by the script.

Building and redeploy
---------------------

1) After successfully running the migration script, you can attempt to build the latest version of the service and deploy.

2) Make sure you've pulled the latest code from the source repository, and modify the following section in
   oib-request/pom.xml to match your database names and authentication credentials.

		<datasource1.url>jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/valuesets_and_logs</datasource1.url>
		<datasource1.driver>com.mysql.jdbc.Driver</datasource1.driver>
		<datasource1.user></datasource1.user>
		<datasource1.password></datasource1.password>

		<datasource2.url>jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/resource_profile</datasource2.url>
		<datasource2.driver>com.mysql.jdbc.Driver</datasource2.driver>
		<datasource2.user></datasource2.user>
		<datasource2.password></datasource2.password>

3) Build using mvn clean install and redeploy the war found in oib-request/oib-request-service/target to your java
   servlet container.
