Site LITE is the Librarian Infobutton Tailoring Environment for OpenInfobutton implementation sites. It is a pure
Javascript project based on the AngularJS technology and implements a custom UI to administer an instance of OpenInfobutton.

1 - Install Prerequisites
2 - Configure environment
3 - Run the application

Install Prerequisites
---------------------

1) Build and install the OpenInfobutton web service, ensuring the resource_profile database is created
2) Build and install the OpenInfobutton responder, or at least ensure it's database is created using the
   'install-db.sh' script found in oib-responder/oib-rdbms-model
3) Make sure the oib-site-lite-rest-server is installed and running or LITE will display no content.
4) Install Javascript Dependencies

    - We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and angular framework code.  The tools help
      us manage and test the application.

    - We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].

    - We get the angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].

    We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply run: npm install

    Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install' and load the angular dependencies into your app/bower_components
    folder.

    *Note that the `bower_components` folder would normally be installed in the root folder but
    angular-seed changes this location through the `.bowerrc` file.  Putting it in the app folder makes
    it easier to serve the files by a webserver.*

Configure environment
---------------------

1) There are 2 files where you might need to make changes:

    - package.json, change 'localhost' and '8000' to match the host name for your environment and the port you'd like
      to use:

     `````````````````````````````````````````````````
     "start": "http-server -a localhost -p 8000 -c-1",

     `````````````````````````````````````````````````

     - app/app.js, this is where I've configured the default URLs and paths used by LITE's REST client:

    `````````````````````````````````````````````````
     localStorage.setItem("hostName", $location.host());
     localStorage.setItem("gitRepo", 'VHAINNOVATIONS/InfoButtons');
     localStorage.setItem("profileStorePath", 'profilestore');

    `````````````````````````````````````````````````
    These parameters are all configurable within the app itself, so it's not necessary to change them here, but you
    can if you know what you're doing.


Run the application
-------------------

1)We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000/app/index.html`

For production, you can minify the entire 'app' directory and deploy the resultant file to a web server of your choice.
