Build Guide For OpenInfobutton Manager

1 - Initial Setup
2 - Building
3 - Building with CMake

Initial Setup
-------------

1) Clone the entire Innovation-182 branch you'd like to build.

2) Install JDK 7.0, which can be downloaded from
   http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
   Use version of 1.7.0_17 JDK or higher.

3) Make sure that your JAVA_HOME environment variable is set to the newly
   installed JDK location, and that your PATH includes %JAVA_HOME%\bin
   (windows) or $JAVA_HOME$/bin (unix).

4) Install Maven 3.0, which can be downloaded from
   http://maven.apache.org/download.html. Make sure that your PATH includes
   the $MVN_HOME/bin directory.

5) Install a MySQL 5.0 server instance on the server you're building.
   http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/

6) If you are behind a proxy, keep in mind that additional setup will be
   required as the build process and the service itself requires an unhindered
   connection to the internet.

7) Obtain a UTS account from here,
   https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/home.html


Building
--------

1) Execute the install-db.sh script found in the Innovations-182/oib-responder/oib-rdbms directory.

2) Navigate back to the oib-responder module directory (this directory)

3) The oib-responder requires database information to be set in the following file,

   src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/jdbc.properties

   ibresponder.jdbc.driverClassName=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
   ibresponder.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/OIB
   ibresponder.jdbc.username=<enter db name>
   ibresponder.jdbc.password=<enter db password>
   ibresponder.jdbc.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect

   Set these to match your local database connection parameters.

4) Run

         $> mvn clean install

   This will compile the OpenInfobutton Responder and run all of the tests in the
   oib-responder source module. Alternatively, you can run

         $> mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true

   This will compile the Responder without running the tests in case you encounter problems
   with the database connections.

   It usually takes some time for maven to download required dependencies
   in the first build.

5) Upon a completed build, the WAR will be found under the oib-responder/target directory.
   Simply deploy it to a functional Java EE servlet container and you should be able to
   start firing requests at it. Alternatively, you can also use the following maven command to start an
   instance of the responder in a self contained Tomcat 7 container.

   mvn clean tomcat7:run-war -Ddatasource1.password=mypass -Ddatasource2.password=mypass -DskipTests

Building with CMake
--------

1) The OpenInfobutton Responder module includes a CMakeLists.txt file. If you use a recent
   version of CMake in your development environment, you simply have to check the MySQL connection
   parameters in the following files,

   oib-responder/CMakeLists.txt

   oib-responder/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/jdbc.properties

   and execute the following commands from the module directory,

   cmake CMakeLists.txt

   ctest

   This should exectute the SQL scripts and build the project as well.
